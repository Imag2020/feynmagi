Strong & Reliable
Keeping your investments and cash safeguarded is our top priority. DEGIRO uses a separate custodian entity to hold your assets. In the event something happens to DEGIRO, your investments will not be treated as recoverable assets to creditors. In addition, when you open an investment account with us, we also open a bank account (Cash Account) in your name at flatexDEGIRO Bank. All your non-invested money is protected up to €100,000 under the German Deposit Guarantee Scheme.












Segregation of assets
Keeping your investments safeguarded is our top priority. That is why we use a separate legal entity (SPV) to segregate your assets. The sole task of this entity is to administer and safeguard your investments. By law, it cannot perform any commercial activities. In the event that something would happen to DEGIRO, your investments will not be treated as recoverable assets to creditors and will remain in the safekeeping of the separate entity. This entity will hold your assets with third parties. Where possible or legally required, DEGIRO will require these third parties to provide for asset segregation to protect the investments of our clients against their bankruptcy. Rules concerning asset segregation are different in every country (both within the EU and outside the EU). If there is no asset segregation concerning a third party in the custody chain, then the financial instruments held with that third party might be lost in case of the bankruptcy of that party. For more information, please see ISI – Investment Services.


Cash Account
When you register with DEGIRO, you will also open a bank account (Cash Account) with flatexDEGIRO Bank. Your uninvested money will then be held in a segregated personal bank account with a personal IBAN. This means your money is then also guaranteed up to €100,000 as the relevant German Deposit Guarantee Scheme (Entschädigungseinrichtung deutscher Banken) applies. Your new Cash Account will be directly connected to your existing DEGIRO investment account. It is not possible to use this Cash Account for other banking matters. You can only use it to hold money so that it is readily available for investments on your DEGIRO account.




Who supervises DEGIRO?
The flatexDEGIRO Bank Dutch Branch, which operates under the name DEGIRO, is the Dutch branch of flatexDEGIRO Bank AG. flatexDEGIRO Bank AG is primarily supervised by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). In the Netherlands, flatexDEGIRO Bank Dutch Branch is subject to integrity supervision by DNB and the supervision of AFM.


Investor Compensation Scheme & Deposit Guarantee Scheme
As a client, your assets are segregated in separate entities and thus protected against the insolvency of DEGIRO. In the unlikely event that the segregated assets cannot be returned to clients, DEGIRO falls under the German Investor Compensation Scheme, which compensates any losses from non-returned assets up to 90% (with a maximum of EUR 20,000).
Furthermore, any money deposited on a DEGIRO Cash Account with flatexDEGIRO Bank AG will be guaranteed up to an amount of EUR 100,000 under the German Deposit Guarantee Scheme
Information about the German Investor Protection Scheme and the German Deposit Guarantee Scheme can be found in English on the BaFin website here.
