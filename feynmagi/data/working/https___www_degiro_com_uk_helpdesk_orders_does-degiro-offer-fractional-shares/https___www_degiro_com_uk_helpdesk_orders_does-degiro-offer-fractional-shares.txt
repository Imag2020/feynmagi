DEGIRO is investing globally for everyone. Previously, investing was often limited to stock exchanges in Europe or the United States. Through one platform, all DEGIRO investors gain access to products and markets worldwide. This means that private investors can spread their investments much better. DEGIRO fits perfectly with the investor who manages his business online. For us, customers do not pay for the salary of unnecessary staff. DEGIRO takes away the last difference between professional and private investors; the fees. Essential for the return of private investors.
