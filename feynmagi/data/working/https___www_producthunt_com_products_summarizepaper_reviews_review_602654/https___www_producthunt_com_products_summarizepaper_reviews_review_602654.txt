A website that condenses research papers.  One of the good uses for AI that can help students and researchers I believe.  It will be such a timesaver, since you can also ask questions regarding the paper that might not be summarized.  
Lastly, mixing the AI to summarize papers and a virtual assistant for inquiries is a promising idea that will surely help within the community.Helpful (1)ShareApr 7, 2023Quentin Kral@qkralThanks for your review.
