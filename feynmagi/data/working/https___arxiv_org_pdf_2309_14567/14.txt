Figure 4. The black line is the observed spectrum of WISE 035934.06-540154.6 from Beiler et al. (2023).
Yellow and orange lines are synthetic spectra generated by model atmospheres with T = 450 K, log
eff
g = 4.5, and solar metallicity from the BT-Settl suite Allard (2014, 2016) and by Lacy & Burrows (2023),
respectively. Principal opacity species are indicated along the top axis.
