9 minutesLast updated on July 3, 2024DEGIRO is one of the most popular brokers in Europe. Set up by former employees of BinckBank in 2013, it now has thousands of ETFs to choose from. And over time, it got the reputation of being one of the cheapest brokers on the market for index investing.The pricing of brokers can be complicated, especially if you're just starting to invest. So our goal is to explain in a simple way the fees that DEGIRO charges when investing in ETFs, and compare it with the other brokers on the market.The different costs with DEGIROSummaryTransaction costsConnectivity costsIncoming transfer costsOutgoing transfer costsTaxesCost of DEGIRO for example ETFsPrice of DEGIRO vs other brokersPrice is not the only criteria when selecting a brokerHow to pay less with DEGIROThe challenges of investing in ETFs through a brokerCurvo: the easier alternative to DEGIRO for ETF¬†investingQuestions you may haveThe different costs with DEGIROSummaryIn a nutshell, you pay a ‚Ç¨1.00 transaction fee for ETFs in the DEGIRO¬†core selection. For all other ETFs, you pay ‚Ç¨3.00 per transaction. On top of the transaction fee, there's a connectivity fee of ‚Ç¨2.50 per stock exchange per year.When looking at it more in detail, DEGIRO charges different types of fees:transaction costsconnectivity costsincoming transfer costsoutgoing transfer coststaxesTransaction costsThe transaction cost is the fee you pay for every purchase or sale you make on the stock market. DEGIRO charges ‚Ç¨1.00 or ‚Ç¨3.00, depending on the inclusion of the ETF¬†in the core selection and the exchange you trade the ETF.DEGIRO's core selection of ETFsFor the ETFs in the core selection, you only pay the ‚Ç¨1.00 handling fee. There's a caveat though: you need to buy the ETF¬†on the right exchange. ETFs are traded on stock exchanges. Famous ones are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq, or Xetra and Euronext Amsterdam in Europe. Because of DEGIRO's rule, the iShares MSCI World Accumulating ETF¬†(also known as IWDA) for instance costs ‚Ç¨1 only on Euronext Amsterdam. If you buy it on the London Stock Exchange, DEGIRO will charge you ‚Ç¨3.There's also a fair use policy that you have to oblige to in order to benefit from the free cost. Every month, the first transaction of the ETF on the right stock exchange will cost ‚Ç¨1 instead of ‚Ç¨3. Subsequent transactions that same month will also cost ‚Ç¨1 provided:the transaction is in the same direction (that is buy/sell) as the first transactionthe value of the transaction is at least ‚Ç¨1,000Make sure you keep these important rules in mind when selecting and buying your ETFs on DEGIRO!Other ETFsFor the ETFs that are not in the core selection, you pay ‚Ç¨3.00 per trade. DEGIRO breaks it down in a ‚Ç¨2.00 commission fee and the ‚Ç¨1.00 handling fee.Note that you will pay ‚Ç¨3.00 also if you buy an ETF¬†from the core selection from the wrong exchange. For instance, if you buy the IWDA¬†ETF¬†on the London Stock Exchange instead of on Euronext Amsterdam, you will pay ‚Ç¨3.00 instead of ‚Ç¨1.00. So pay attention to this important detail!Connectivity costsA peculiarity of DEGIRO is that they charge a connectivity fee of ‚Ç¨2.50 per stock exchange per year. This means that you need to pay ‚Ç¨2.50 in a given year for each stock exchange where you've purchased or sold an ETF.DEGIRO waives the connectivity cost for the home exchanges though:üá≥üá± DEGIRO.nl: no fee for Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Brussels.üá´üá∑ DEGIRO.fr: no fee for Euronext Paris and Euronext Brussels.üáÆüáπ DEGIRO.it: no fee for the MTA Italian exchange.Incoming transfer costsEach country-specific DEGIRO charges different fees if you wish to transfer your assets from another broker to DEGIRO:üá≥üá± DEGIRO.nl: free if the value of your portfolio exceeds ‚Ç¨3,000, or else ‚Ç¨10 per position.üá´üá∑ DEGIRO.fr: free if the value of your portfolio exceeds ‚Ç¨3,000 and only for the first 10 positions, else it's ‚Ç¨10 per position.üáÆüáπ DEGIRO.it: ‚Ç¨10 per position.Outgoing transfer costsJust like for incoming transfers, each country-specific DEGIRO charges different fees from transferring your assets to another broker:üá≥üá± DEGIRO.nl: it's unclear how much they charge.üá´üá∑ DEGIRO.fr: ‚Ç¨10 per position, with an unclear "external costs" fee.üáÆüáπ DEGIRO.it: ‚Ç¨10 per position, with an unclear "external costs" fee.TaxesTaxes are local and specific to your country of residence.For Italians üáÆüáπDEGIRO operates under the declaratory regime. Essentially, this means they do not handle the taxes related to investing for you: Capital gains: equal to 26%, due if profitable positions were closed out during the yearIVAFE: equal to 0.2% of the value of financial assets heldHowever, DEGIRO pays the Italian Financial Transaction Tax (also known as the FTT). DEGIRO automatically calculates, withholds, reports, and pays on behalf of clients the Italian FTT due.We wrote a guide to help you with the relevant taxes when investing through DEGIRO.For Belgians üáßüá™DEGIRO declares and pays the Belgian transaction tax. However, they do not handle the other taxes related to investing:Tax on dividends (‚Äúroerende voorheffing‚Äù or ‚Äúpr√©compte mobilier‚Äù). A 30% tax on the dividends you perceive through the stock ETFs that you hold. You need to make sure that you calculate and declare them in your yearly tax declaration.Tax on capital gains on bond funds (also known as the Reynders tax). There‚Äôs a 30% tax on the profits you make when you choose to sell the bonds in your portfolio. Again, DEGIRO pushes the responsibility to you for declaring the right amounts in your tax declaration.You also need to declare your DEGIRO account to the National Bank of Belgium and on your yearly tax form.Cost of DEGIRO for example ETFsAs an example, we calculate the cost of DEGIRO for buying ‚Ç¨1,000 of two of the most popular ETFs in Europe:Vanguard FTSE All-World Accumulating (VWCE)iShares MSCI World Accumulating (IWDA)You can also calculate the transaction cost for any ETF of your choosing below.Vanguard FTSE All-World Accumulating (VWCE)VWCE (ISIN: IE00BK5BQT80) is popular in the index investing community. The fund was launched by Vanguard in 2019 and currently holds more than ‚Ç¨5 billion under management. Vanguard is one of the largest asset managers in the world, and its founder Jack Bogle is often credited as the inventor of the index fund.VWCE tracks the FTSE All-World index, a combination of the FTSE Developed Markets index and the FTSE Emerging Markets index. The index consists of over 4,000 stocks. Because it's so diversified, investors can find in VWCE a great way to follow the global stock market by holding a significant portion of the world's stocks. Companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc‚Ä¶ are represented in the index. The FTSE All-World index has delivered an average of 8.4% per year since 2005.VWCE is part of DEGIRO's core selection. So you will pay ‚Ç¨1.00 per transaction on XETRA¬†and a connectivity fee of ‚Ç¨2.50 per year.Transaction cost to buy ‚Ç¨1,000Connectivity costExchange‚Ç¨1.00‚Ç¨2.50Xetra‚Ç¨3.00‚Ç¨2.50Borsa Italiana‚Ç¨3.00‚Ç¨0.00Euronext Amsterdam‚Ç¨3.00‚Ç¨2.50Stuttgart Stock ExchangeiShares MSCI World Accumulating (IWDA)IWDA (ISIN:¬†IE00B4L5Y983) is an ETF that tracks the MSCI World index, an index composed of about 1,500 stocks from 23 countries that economists qualify as "developed": United States, Germany, Japan‚Ä¶ The fund is offered by iShares, a brand of BlackRock.

If you had invested ‚Ç¨10,000 in 1979, you would have had around ‚Ç¨900,000 today.This fund is also part of DEGIRO's core selection of ETFs!

Unfortunately you are unable to automate your investments using DEGIRO.The challenges of investing in ETFs through a brokerWhen managing your own investments through a broker, you have to figure out what to buy, when to buy, understand the tax implications of your decisions, rebalance your investments and make sure they stay in line with your goals and risk tolerance. There are quite a few challenges:The allocation of your portfolio is in your hands: figure out how to build the right allocation that meets your long-term goals.You need to do your homework: figuring out how to start and understanding the intricacies of investing in ETFs takes an effort. Yet it's important, because in investing the details matter.It takes time: send money to your broker monthly and then make the purchases. Costly for monthly contributions: if you wish to invest on a monthly basis, you‚Äôll have to pay a lot in broker fees. Also, as you buy units and can‚Äôt buy fractions, you‚Äôll always be left with cash on your account. Learn how to rebalance your portfolio: if you have multiple funds in your portfolio, how will you rebalance? Quarterly or yearly? How do you decide?Keep track of your portfolio: you may have to set up a spreadsheet to stay on top of things!Understand taxes: this can be complicated and they also often change.Discipline: it requires self-confidence and discipline to stay the course.Brokers want you to trade: the majority of brokers make money on you trading so a ‚Äúpassive‚Äù approach isn‚Äôt in their best interest.Curvo: the easier alternative to DEGIRO for ETF¬†investingWe realised the difficulties of investing through brokers like DEGIRO.
