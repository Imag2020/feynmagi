Abstract:We study the f(Q,T) gravity in the framework of Weyl geometry (known as Weyl-type f(Q,T) gravity), where Q denotes the non-metricity scalar, and T denotes the energy-momentum tensor trace. In this work, we consider the f(Q,T) model, which is defined as f(Q,T)=αQm+1+β6κ2T and investigating two scenarios: (I) m=0 (linear model) and (II) m≠0 (nonlinear model). For both scenarios, we find the explicit solution for the field equations by using the barotropic equation of state as p=ωρ, where ω is the equation-of-state (EoS) parameter. Further, we study the obtained solutions statistically using the Pantheon+ dataset with 1701 data points. For both models, the best-fit values of model parameters for 1−σ and 2−σ confidence level are mentioned in table 1 and 2. We statistically compare our models to the ΛCDM model using χ2min, χ2red, AIC and ΔAIC. We also examined the current values of cosmological parameters such as deceleration and EoS parameters to determine the current acceleration expansion of the universe. Furthermore, we test our model using Om diagnostic and compare it to the ΛCDM model to determine its dark energy profile. Finally, we draw the conclusion that, statistically speaking, Weyl f(Q,T) model I (linear model) is more compatible with the ΛCDM model than Weyl f(Q,T) model II (nonlinear model).
