Abstract:Guided waves are the perfect carriers of electromagnetic signals in planar miniaturized devices due to their high localization and controlled propagation direction. However, it is still a challenge to control the polarization of propagating guided waves. In this work, we discover both theoretically and experimentally the broadband polarization TE-TM degeneracy of highly localized guided waves propagating along an all-dielectric metasurface and a subwavelength chain of dielectric high-index cylinders. Using the discovered near-field polarization degree of freedom, we demonstrate experimentally the polarization transformation for guided waves propagating along a subwavelength chain of dielectric cylinders at any frequency within the finite spectral range. Namely, we implement the simplest planar near-field polarization device -- the quarter-wave-retardation (linear-to-circular) polarization transformer of guided waves. The results obtained discover the polarization degree of freedom for guided waves paving the way towards numerous applications in flat optics and planar photonics.
